This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native with an object or array as the initial state.  If you update the state by directly modifying the object or array (e.g., `state.push()`, `state.property = newValue`), React won't detect the change, leading to a UI that doesn't reflect the updated data. This is because React performs shallow comparisons to determine if a re-render is needed.  Shallow comparison only checks if the reference has changed, not the contents of the object or array.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [myArray, setMyArray] = useState([1, 2, 3]);

  const addElement = () => {
    myArray.push(4); // Incorrect way to update state
    console.log(myArray); // Shows [1, 2, 3, 4]
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{JSON.stringify(myArray)}</Text> {/* Still shows [1, 2, 3] */} 
      <Button title="Add Element" onPress={addElement} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
